## Module 3 Mastery Project

### Goals
Build a dynamic web application with a MVC architecture. 
- Use TDD to create a suite of unit tests and integration tests.
- Keep your code clean.
  - Follow We Can Code IT's Java Style guide when writing your code.
  - Use proper naming conventions.
  - Make clear and concise names for methods and variables.
  - Use OOP practices when you can.
- Make effective use of git and GitHub.
  - Make frequent commits.
  - Utilize feature branching.
- Working Software based on the Module 3 Mastery guideline at [Module 3 Mastery](https://wecancodeit-materials.netlify.com/exercises/mastery/blog-ssr/) 
  - We are looking for an web application that utilizes a MVC architecture using spring boot.  
  - We need to see dynamic content being rendered and the ability to add content to the application through an HTML form.
  - Upon submission we should have an application that starts and passes all tests in the test folder.
  - Prepare a custom README.md file.  Smart Columbus Open Data Enthusiasts provide a good resource for what an README.md could look like [here.](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/scode-repo-template/blob/master/README.md)
 ### Resources
 In addition to [We Can Code IT materials](https://wecancodeit-materials.netlify.com/cohorts/java/module-three/), we've included a [HELP.md](./HELP.md) file that is provided by Spring Initializr to help with Spring documentation.
