# Blog Site
## Module 3 Mastery Project
## L Double T Blog Site
#### Trey Grace & LaTerrell Humphries
#####Goal
Build a dynamic web application with a MVC architecture. 
#####What we accomplished
-We started our project by making static html prototypes of what we wanted our blog site to look like.

-Using TDD, We created all our POJOs, our Storage Classes, and our Controller Classes.

-Also, used TDD JpaWiring Test to ensure all our POJOs were mapped correctly.

-We created a Populator Class to prefill our website with some blog information.

-Based of html prototypes, we created dynamic html templates for List of Categories, All blogs in a category, List of Authors, All blogs by an Author, List of Tags, and All blogs with a specific tag.

-We also made a dynamic html template to display actual blog posts.

-Users have the ability to add a Category to the page displaying all categories.

-Users have the ability to add an Author to the page displaying all Authors.

-Users have the ability to add Tags to individual blog posting and then find all blogs with similar Tags.

-Users have the ability to add their own blog post with Authors and Categories already in the database. 

- Authors and Categories must be added before adding review.
